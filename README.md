Hello, I'm Kaya Canda👋

💻My Story:

I've been interested in scripting and coding since I was a kid.🧒 I started learning scratch when I was in first grade from youtube videos. Later I started going to a coding course where I started learning lego mindstorm EV3. It was pretty basic and easy for me after a year of learning EV3, I started learning Ardunio when I was a 4th grader🔌. After basic arduino, I figured out how to make IOT projects and started learning advanced Arduino in  fifth grade. 🌅Last summer I started learning C# and I am currently learning basic level python.

🎯My goals: 

• 🤖I want to be able build high-tech AI sytems in the future and help humanity grow.

• ☕I also want to make some programs or Arduino projects that will help me with my daily life to make things easier.
